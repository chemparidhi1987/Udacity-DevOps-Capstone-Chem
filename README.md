# Cloud DevOps Engineer Capstone Project

This project represents the successful completion of the last final Capstone project and the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.

## What did I learn?

In this project, I applied the skills and knowledge I developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:
- Using Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Building pipelines
- Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
- Building Kubernetes clusters
- Building Docker containers in pipelines
- Working in AWS

## Application

The Application is based on a python3 script using <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> to render a simple webpage in the user's browser.
A requirements.txt is used to ensure that all needed dependencies come along with the Application.

## Kubernetes Cluster

I used AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Kubernetes Cluster.
The CloudFormation Deployment can be broken down into four Parts:
- **Networking**, to ensure new nodes can communicate with the Cluster
- **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is used to create a Kubernetes Cluster
- **NodeGroup**, each NodeGroup has a set of rules to define how instances are operated and created for the EKS-Cluster
- **Management** is needed to configure and manage the Cluster and its deployments and services. I created two management hosts for extra redundancy if one of them fails.

## CircleCi - CI/CD Pipelines

I used CircleCi to create a CI/CD Pipeline to test and deploy changes manually before they get deployed automatically to the Cluster using Ansible.

## Linting using Pylint and Hadolint

Linting is used to check if the Application and Dockerfile is syntactically correct.
This process makes sure that the code quality is always as good as possible.
